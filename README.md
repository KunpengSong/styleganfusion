This is the official repository of "Diffusion Guided Domain Adaptation of Image Generators".

## checkpoints to start with:
Please download stylegan2 and eg3d checkpoints from (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kY9wEK7hQaO_MGMkeHVmBKfXcfUoYrH4?usp=sharing), and put them in the download folder. 

The code is ready to run now after downloading checkpoints. Please use .sh files as entrances. 

A few notices:
+ Results are saved in the logs folder. We also shared a lot of log images at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1l4e7zAu5FwB4wrnUy-EDJC5-sSEZjs_C?usp=share_link 
+ We use diffusers to load stablediffusion checkpoint from huggingface. A TOKEN file is included to get access to the checkpoints. Please replace it with your own token file, which can be applied here: https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4

Cheers!
